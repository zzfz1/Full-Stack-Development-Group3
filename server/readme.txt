3.Description: 

Here's a step-by-step flow of how these components interact:

1. A client (e.g., web browser or mobile app) sends an HTTP request to your server (e.g., to create a new category).
2. The request is received by the appropriate route (e.g., a POST request to /categories).
3. The route calls the corresponding controller method (e.g., categoryController.createCategory).
4. The controller method processes the request, interacts with the model to perform the necessary database operation 
5. (e.g., creating a new category in the database), and returns an appropriate response (e.g., success or error message) to the client.
