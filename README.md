### Project Overview
#### Description
This is a e-commerce web shop for 3d Printers.
#### Branches and project management
During development, our team aimed at concrete task assignment to each inidividual and clear view of the overall repository. 

Our main branches before final merge: 
* Client - frontend 
* Server - backend/server
* Admin  - admin version

You can see that each main () has its own branch.
But during developing features on each branch? 
We have used "sub-branches". Basically, there will be a new branch for each new feature of the branch which the dev works on.

e.g Branch structure of Client

__Client

├── Product page          
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── product-cart             
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── product-list             
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── ...
